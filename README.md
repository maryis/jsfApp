this app used myface (implementation of apache from jsf) and primefaces and hibernate-jpa

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the Java standard technology (a specification) for building component-based, event-oriented web interfaces. Like JavaServer Pages (JSP), JSF allows access to server-side data and logic. Unlike JSP, which is essentially an HTML page imbued with server-side capabilities, JSF is an XML document that represents formal components in a logical tree. JSF components are backed by Java objects, which are independent of the HTML and have the full range of Java abilities, including accessing remote APIs and databases.

- two implementations: Oracle Mojarra and Apache MyFaces
- JSF component libraries : A component library is something which adds extra functionality (normally extra UI widgets) to the base specification such as primefaces, icefaces, richfaces
